\section*{Project outline}
My final year project will have both hardware and software parts. The aim of the project is to build additional unit which will ensure that camera mounted on the rover is always in stable position. Currently there is a Pan-and-Tilt Unit (PTU) which controls the camera and ensures that it is in a stable position. It uses gyroscopes to acquire current position in the space and based on data from them adjust position of the camera. However those gyroscopes are not perfect and tend to drift over the time as well as provide wrong data at the different temperature. 

I will be building additional unit which will acquire current position using the more accurate accelerometer and then will provide PTU with the calibration data.

\section*{Process}
At this point it is difficult for me to choose the right development methodology for my project. There are so many of them and I have very limited experience of using any of them; and anyway I will most probably end up with code and fix approach. It may sound strange, but when I started looking in to the development methodologies for my final year project I actually found out that it is not the same thing as system development life-cycle. While life-cycle describes processes for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an system, software development methodologies focusses on structuring, planning and controlling processes.  

1 key steps of the project and how you will use these on single person project
2 entire lifecycle for your project
3 Issues: Key steps of the project
		1 establishing requirements
		2 tracking progress
		3 create a design
		4 undertake development and testing
		
		
		
 1 It is likely that I will be coming back to the requirements analysis during development so phased development would be unsuitable
 2 Difference between methodologies and life-cycle
