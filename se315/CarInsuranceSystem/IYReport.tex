\chapter{CSA Application}
\subsubsection{In IS}
When I joined the IS department I was surprised by the amount of people working there. There should be around 60 people working in the department to support the University's library and IT stuff. I don't think that students and staff realize how much work is done behind the scenes to ensure that university functions. There is a team supporting networking; the one that develops new applications, other people deal with the books; I was placed within the team providing computer hardware and software support. I have had some previous experience in supporting MS Windows OS for the friends and the family as well as having hardware knowledge since I have built a few computers from the components before. I think I was placed within this team because I have expressed a deep interest in the computer hardware on the interview day.
